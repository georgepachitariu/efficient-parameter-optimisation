# efficient-parameter-optimisation

This website was built using html,css,javascript(+jquery) for client side and python for the server side (the django framework).

The website does this:
  - Allows the user to play a game and compete with an offline algorithm;
  - Displays data using graphs (http://www.highcharts.com/);
  - Logs the user behaviour (which buttons are clicked & when they are clicked & by whom they are clicked);
  - Uses AWS-S3 to store all the data files and logs;
